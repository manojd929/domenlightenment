<body>
  <div>
    <\script> element has an attribute called defer that will defer the blocking, downloading, and executing of an external JavaScript
      file until the browser has parsed the closing
      <\html> node
  </div>
  <div>
    <p>
      The
      <\script> element has an attribute called async that will override the sequential blocking nature of
        <\script> elements when the DOM is being constructed by a web browser. By using this attribute, we are telling the browser
          not to block the construction (i.e. DOM parsing, including downloading other assets e.g. images, style sheets,
          etc...) of the html page and forgo the the sequential loading as well.

    //We know that jQuery is not avaliable because this occurs before the closing <html> element
    console.log(window['jQuery'] === undefined); //logs true

    //Only after everything is loaded can we safley conclude that jQuery was loaded and parsed
    document.body.onload = function () { console.log(jQuery().jquery) }; //logs function
