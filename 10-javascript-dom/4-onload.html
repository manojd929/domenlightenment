  <p>
    script element supports a load event handler (ie. onload) that will execute once an external JavaScript file has been loaded
    and executed.
    In the code below I leverage the onload event to create a callback programatically notifying us when the
    JavaScript file has been downloaded and exectued.

  <script>
    var underscoreScript = document.createElement("script");
    underscoreScript.src = "http://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/underscore.js/1.3.3/underscore-min.js";
    underscoreScript.onload = function () { console.log('underscsore is loaded and exectuted'); };
    document.body.appendChild(underscoreScript);
  </script>

  <script async src="http://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.7.2/jquery.min.js" onload="console.log('jQuery is loaded and exectuted');"></script>
