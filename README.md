My understanding of the DOM aka Document Object Model
referring to domenlightenment.com by Cody Lindley

Takeaways from this :

    . The whole point of JS libraries is to abstract away the internal APIs of browser and provide different and better API instead
    . The purpose of DOM is to provide progmatic interface for scripting (add, remove, replace, eventing , modifying) this live document using          javascript
    . Live document here means HTML documents get parsed by the browser and are converted into tree structure consisting of node objects
